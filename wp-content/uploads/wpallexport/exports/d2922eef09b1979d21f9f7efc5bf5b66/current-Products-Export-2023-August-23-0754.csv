<p>Color-BLACK. Works with all brands of RV Awnings.  Rollers on all brands of longer awnings will have a tendency to bounce and flex during travel.  This can over time lead to the roller taking a permanent set, causing wobbly roll-up and an undesirable  canopy.  The Carefree Awning Support Cradle receives the roller and supports it eliminating sag.  Unroll the awning and the Automatic Support Cradle releases the roller and pivots open, ready to accept the roller again.  The patented support action of our unique cradle receives the roller and gently supports it eliminating all the weight and natural sag in the middle of the roller. Easy to install and go, no need to tension this awning support after you roll up the awning!  Please note: Will not work on awnings with Uniguard.</p>

<p>Works with all brands of RV Awnings.  Rollers on all brands of longer awnings will have a tendency to bounce and flex during travel.  This can over time lead to the roller taking a permanent set, causing wobbly roll-up and an undesirable  canopy.  The Carefree Awning Support Cradle receives the roller and supports it eliminating sag.  Unroll the awning and the Automatic Support Cradle releases the roller and pivots open, ready to accept the roller again.  The patented support action of our unique cradle receives the roller and gently supports it eliminating all the weight and natural sag in the middle of the roller. Easy to install and go, no need to tension this awning support after you roll up the awning!  Please note: Will <b>not</b> work on awnings with Uniguard.</p>",902800W,simple,0,,

76999,"Apex Replacement Canopy","The Apex Patio Awning offers the coach owner an awning system that provides as much or as little shade as required. The canopies are housed in an aluminum case that easily blends in with the coach roof.

Each unit is equipped with Apex lateral support arms that are the strongest available on the market. No vertical arms interfere with coach sidewalls or equipment that may be mounted on the roof. These arms can also be adjusted to vary the canopy pitch up to 3 feet (it is strongly recommended that service and adjustments be performed by trained technicians).

The unique and innovative 110V electronic control system provides Carefree’s newest Direct Response system with interior pushbutton controls for standard extend/retract functions. At the master control panel the auto-retract system can be engaged to automatically retract the awning in windy conditions. Sensitivity can be set to respond to a variety of wind speed conditions. An RF remote is furnished with the Direct Response system.

Apex is an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) product available on select motor homes only, ask the manufacturer of your choice to include the Paramount or Apex awning systems on your next motor home purchase.

77032,Pioneer,"<h2>Quick, Easy, Manual Operation</h2>
The Carefree Pioneer manual awning is the easiest full size patio awning to operate. No need to worry about unlocking travel locks or spring mechanisms with this awning. To open the Pioneer, simply turn the hand crank. Once it is fully open, slide the single track slider arm up to the roller and tighten the rafter knobs. Now you can raise the roller with the lift handles to any desired pitch. It’s that simple.

For an exceptionally taut canopy, backwind the crank to make your canopy as tight as a drum. There’s never a need to re-tension your canopy. In breezy conditions, the worm gear mechanism will not allow your roller to unwind. When finished using your awning, lower the roller tube, loosen the rafter knobs and slide the rafter arms to the closed position. Just turn the hand crank in the opposite direction until the roller is tight against the coach and you’re ready for travel. That’s it. There’s no locks or straps to fuss with to prevent billowing in transit. The crank assembly automatically locks the roller in place. Available in all fabric styles and colors including Carefree’s patented no leak Alumaguard or Uniguard.
