== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What type of disabilities does EqualWeb assist with?
EqualWeb technology takes into account people’s wide range of disabilities, limitations, and various disorders when it comes to Web accessibility.
The system was developed in close cooperation with disabled people of any type. Throughout the development, we realized how differently people with distinct problems surf the Internet, what their difficulties are, and how we could assist and support them:
Full or partial blindness, requiring the use of screen reading software such as NVDA or JAWS.
Motor disabilities such as joint injuries, limb amputations, and more.
Parkinson's disease - trembling hands, enabling to use the mouse.
Seniors' limitations - with a wide variety of disabilities.
Epilepsy – sensitive to flash animations that can cause seizures.
Cognitive disabilities  -such as memory disorders, dyslexia, post-stroke, and more.
Various visual impairments - such as color blindness, cataract, glaucoma, and more.

= Does the EqualWeb plugin affect loading speed?
EqualWeb does not affect the site's performance at all and does not collect any data either. Our system loads only after the entire site is loaded and fully rendered by the browser. Your website will always load at full speed, with compressed files (GZIP) and full cashing, allowing the surfers full and proper use of the website at all times.
Do you provide technical/Adjustment Support?
Of course! We are continuously here to assist with any problem at any time!
Once you purchase our widget and install it, we are here to assist and solve any issue you might come across, from the installation process to the ongoing customers' and end users' handling, receiving feedbacks, and malfunction reports. 

= Can you customize the EqualWeb widget or menu design?
Yes! EqualWeb is fully customizable and can easily match your website's design. You can choose your preferred color, on-screen display, icons, sizing, background shape, language, and even the accessibility button placement. All this can be set and edited from your Equalweb account. 

= Does EqualWeb adhere to WCAG?
Yes. Our technology solution adheres to WCAG 2.1 guidelines with an intuitive and seamless browsing experience for all. We continuously update our Systems so we continuously stay in compliance with all international applicable regulations such as WCAG 2.1 AA+, the US Section 508, and the European Union Law EU 301549.

= Does EqualWeb Widget intervene with the site's source code?
No! EqualWeb Widget does not interfere with the site's original source code whatsoever.
EqualWeb tool only "COATS" the website on the side by the time it is loaded.
For example: even if the user performs an action on the tool according to his requirements, the widget won't do anything to the site's code; and in any case, the system WILL NEVER change, delete, save or update anything from the source code. We only provide a code that the client himself adds to the source code of his website (Client-Side) - these changes occur only in the Document Object Model (DOM) – we and use CSS and JS, so no system-level or server-level interfaces are required.

= Under which standards does the EqualWeb plugin stand?
EqualWeb WordPress plugin and services are GDPR & CCPA compliant, as it does not collect any personal or identifiable data about the visitors. Please refer to our privacy policy for more information. EqualWeb products operate under ISO/IEC 27001 standard and maintain facilities that are secure against electronic and physical intrusions.

= How can you make my website fully accessible and compliant?
In order to reach 100% compliance, our accessibility experts and QA team, comprised of people with disabilities, will review your website and will perform a manual audit via reader software in order to remediate all the found issues.
